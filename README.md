# Task-3
Git merge and Git branch with README

# 1. Version Control:
Version control is a system that tracks changes to a project's code or files over time. It allows multiple contributors to work collaboratively on a project, providing mechanisms to manage different versions of the code, track changes, and easily roll back to previous states if needed. Version control systems (VCS) help teams maintain code integrity, collaborate efficiently, and manage complex software development projects.

# 2. Difference between Git and GitHub:
1. Git: Git is a distributed version control system that allows users to track changes in their source code during software development. It runs locally on a developer's machine and doesn't require a network connection.

1. GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers additional collaboration features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and wikis. GitHub is a service built around Git to facilitate collaboration and sharing of code among developers.

# 3. Three Alternatives:
1. GitLab: GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management (SCM), continuous integration, and more, similar to GitHub.

1. Bitbucket: Bitbucket, developed by Atlassian, is a Git and Mercurial code repository management solution. It offers features like pull requests, code review, and integration with other Atlassian tools.

1. SourceForge: SourceForge is an older platform that hosts version control repositories. It provides features like bug tracking, project management, and collaborative tools.

# 4. Difference between git fetch and git pull:
1. git fetch: Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository to your local repository but does not automatically merge them into your working branch. It allows you to see what changes are available without applying them.

1. git pull: Pull, on the other hand, fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into the current branch. It's a combination of git fetch and git merge.

# 5. Git rebase
Git rebase is a command used to modify the commit history of a branch. It integrates changes from one branch into another by moving or combining commits. It is often used to maintain a linear and clean commit history. The command is: 'git rebase <base_branch>'

# 6. Git Cherry-pick:
Git cherry-pick is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It allows you to pick individual commits and apply them to a different branch. The command is: 'git cherry-pick <commit-hash>'
